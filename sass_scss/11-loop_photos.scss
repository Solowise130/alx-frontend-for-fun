// Description: This Sass file creates a class for each name in $list-names and assigns a background image based on the name.
// Using @import to bring in any necessary dependencies and @each to iterate through the list.

@import 'path-to-your-other-sass-file-if-needed';  // You can replace this with the actual path if needed.

$list-names: john, jane, doe; // Sample list, you can expand this or import it from another file.

@each $name in $list-names {
    .#{$name} {
        background-image: url('#{$name}.jpg');
    }
}
